## Key Corrections Applied Throughout

### Data Format Corrections (As Requested)

All sections marked "## shall correct..." have been addressed:

#### ❌ **OLD (Incorrect):**
```python
fNIR: (102, 128, 23, N)   # Wrong
dNIR: (102, 128, 22, N)   # Wrong
img4D: (102, 128, 9, 23)  # Wrong
```

#### ✅ **NEW (Corrected):**
```python
# 3-LED Mode (Breast Sizes A-C)
fNIR: (102, 128, 25, 3)   # 25 scanning cycles, 3 LEDs
dNIR: (102, 128, 24, 3)   # 24 differences (25-1)
img4D: (102, 128, 9, 25)  # 9 layers, 25 cycles

# 5-LED Mode (Breast Sizes D+)
fNIR: (102, 128, 15, 5)   # 15 scanning cycles, 5 LEDs
dNIR: (102, 128, 14, 5)   # 14 differences (15-1)
img4D: (102, 128, 9, 15)  # 9 layers, 15 cycles
```

### Model Architecture Corrections

All architecture diagrams have been updated:

#### ❌ **OLD:**
```
Input: (B, 23, C, H, W)
```

#### ✅ **NEW:**
```
Input: (B, 25, C, H, W)  # For 3-LED mode
```
